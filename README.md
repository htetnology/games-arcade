This is a simple game program consisting of 2 games: NumberGuessingGame and WordScramble. As per coursework requirements, only the NumberGuessingGame class was required to be developed from scratch. Additionally, minor improvements and commentaries were expected to improve the remaining classes. GamesArcade is the main class used to run the program. Developed using Java and Eclipse IDE.
